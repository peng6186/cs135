I spent 20 hours on this problem ( 5 hours Q1-Q4,  8 hours on Q5, and the rest of the time just reading and doing some research on documentation )

I sought help from Sklearn, and Matplotlib documentation.

I mainly search What ROC and AUC means, and how to use sklearn corresponding models. 
And how to add and adjust many components on plowing graph.
