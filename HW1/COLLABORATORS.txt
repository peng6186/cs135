Name: Pengcheng Xu

I spent 8 hours on this problem (1 on Prob. 1 and 3 on Prob. 2)
- I spent 2 or 3 hours on the problems, but before that I spent 4 or 5 hours reviewing Numpy, since     	I'm kind of rusty with Python and Numpy

I sought help from Prof. Huckleberry.

- I sought help from the Numpy documentation from the link provided by HW description

We talked about the definition of Euclidean distance.

- That documentation provide a very good hint on how to calculate Euclidean distance (i.e. vector broadcasting), which helps a lot.
